First project I have ever written with a functional gui. Up tp this point all my projects used the terminal for display.

### Lessons learned:
1) GUI Development.
2) Java Swing.
3) Event handlers.
4) Algorithm implementation: Shunting Yard algorithm.
5) Git and github basics.

Implementing the evaluation code (Shunting-yard algorithm) still work in progress.
